#Exercise 1: Working with a while loop
#Welcome to Guess the Number! Game
import random

print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
print("The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.")

#generate a random number between 1 and 10 by using the randint() function of the random module
number = random.randint(1,10)

#Track whether the user guessed your number by creating a variable called isGuessRight
isGuessRight = False

#To handle the game logic, create a while loop
while isGuessRight != True:
    guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
    if int(guess) == number:
        print("You guessed {}. That is correct! You win!".format(guess))
        isGuessRight = True
    else:
        print("You guessed {}. Sorry, that isnâ€™t it. Try again.".format(guess))

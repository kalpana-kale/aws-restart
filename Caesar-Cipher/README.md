To drive the discussion of user-defined functions, you will write a program that implements a Caesar cipher, which is a simple method of encryption. 
A Caesar cipher takes the letters of a message and shifts each letter along the alphabet by a certain number of places.

In this lab, you will:

Create user-defined functions
Use several functions to implement a Caesar cipher encryption program
